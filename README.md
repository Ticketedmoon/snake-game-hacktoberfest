#### Hacktoberfest Snake Game
#### By: Shane

So, I decided to build a snake game for the Repository https://github.com/Prouser123/PyOS/issues/22  
The game is built using Python 2.7 & Pygame. 
##### You must use Python2.7 for this game.  

Intructions:
1. Clone the repository 
2. Change directory into the code directory
3. `python Launcher.py` will play the game
4. Required package: pygame==1.9.4 | simply just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the project root directory in your shell.
